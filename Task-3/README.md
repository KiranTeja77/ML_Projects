# Task 3: CNN for Image Classification

## Objective

Build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify handwritten digits using the **MNIST** dataset.

## Dataset

- MNIST dataset (loaded using `tensorflow.keras.datasets`)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- matplotlib

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded and normalized MNIST image data.
2. Built a CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense layers.
3. Trained the model using categorical cross-entropy.
4. Evaluated model on the test dataset.

## How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook CNN_image_classification.ipynb
```

## Output

- Training and validation accuracy
- Test accuracy
- Model summary
